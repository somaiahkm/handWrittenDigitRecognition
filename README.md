It's a stand alone mobile application which works offline, as the entire trained model is present inside application. 
This repo contains:
-> Android Studio files : Design file(.xml), Activity file(.java), build.gradle.
-> Python file : Script that preprocesses the image and runs the model on the image. Code which generates the machine learning model
which has been encoded into a pickle file.
